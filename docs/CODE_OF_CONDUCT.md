# Code of Conduct

The Griote Platform is an open-source project that is maintained by a diverse group of contributors and users from around the world. As such, the success of the project depends on the active participation of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives. This Code of Conduct is meant to outline our expectations for contributor behavior as well as outline consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free environment for all contributors, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, religion, or other personal characteristics.

We expect contributors to adhere to the following principles:

* Be respectful of other contributors, maintaining a positive and respectful tone in all interactions.
* Refrain from using language that is discriminatory, offensive, or threatening in nature.
* Focus on providing constructive feedback that is specific, objective, and actionable.
* Avoid using language that is demeaning or exclusionary, whether based on an individual's race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or other personal characteristics.

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in one or more of the following consequences:

* A warning, either public or private, explaining why the behavior was inappropriate and requesting that the contributor adhere to the Code of Conduct in the future.
* A temporary ban from contributing to the project.
* A permanent ban from contributing to the project.
* Removal of inappropriate content or comments.

We expect all contributors to adhere to this Code of Conduct. If you witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact the project maintainers at [contact@griote.org](mailto:contact@griote.org).
