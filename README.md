## Overview

Griote Platform collects, structures, and preserves academic works, traditional knowledge, code, datasets, and research produced in Africa. It provides a unified, open-access hub for this knowledge and serves as the primary data foundation for **GrioteAI**, a sovereign African large language model trained on African languages, cultures, and realities.

**Vision:** Empower Africa with its own AI and knowledge infrastructure.
